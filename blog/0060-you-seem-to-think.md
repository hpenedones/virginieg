You seem to think all this goodness lives within me and only me.

My friend this luscious world you see lives in my heart as well as yours.

And if in me riches you see, and goodness and the world, this is because your heart and mine connect to make a better world.

Not in my heart or in your mind, but in my heart and in yours too.

So my dear friend never forget what your eyes see you can obtain, what your heart feels you can sustain.
