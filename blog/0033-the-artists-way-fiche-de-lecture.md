J'ai complété ¨The Artist Way¨ (J. Cameron) et voici ce que j'en ai pensé, en (très) bref…

**1) Quel est le point du livre qui vous semble le plus important à retenir**

That each of us has a creative side in them, very often buried, and that we have to work to let it surface again, and that if we do great things can happen.

**2) Comment vais-je utiliser le contenu de ce livre pour aller plus loin dans la construction de ma posture d'auteur et dans mon écriture?**

I did the Artist's way last year, from April to July 2016. Since then I have kept the practice of the morning pages, as well as the artist's dates for a long time. Since I left London and don't have my own place, routine, … it has been a little harder but I am keen to start doing my artist's date again.

**3) Quel est le point sur lequel j'aurais souhaité que l'auteur aille plus loin et comment vais-je l'approfondir? (Ex livre, …)**

J. Cameron does not talk about technical points at all, which makes sense as her book as other intentions, I am interested in learning more about them so I have read things like ¨into the woods¨, ¨save the cat¨, will continue with ¨how to write your script in 21 days and the hero with 1000 faces.
